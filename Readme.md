#### For Salons:
Viola app uses the data you provide to reach your clients, such as social media links and contact information.

#### For Clients:
Viola app saves your contact information to keep a record of your favorite salons and facilitates job applications with salons, which will be accessible only to registered salons. Other than that, Viola is committed to not using your data for any other purposes.

Viola uses the data of salons and clients to provide the best services to both, according to geographic locations. This allows us to list salons based on proximity. Contact information is used to enable clients to reserve appointments and make other inquiries. Even so, clients can benefit from 99% of Viola’s services without needing to provide any personal data (just browsing as a guest).

Viola is committed to not sharing or publicizing any information or data of salons and clients to any third parties for any reason.

Viola is committed to using the best service providers to host its servers, selecting those with the highest trust ratings and best data security standards.

Viola is committed to not detecting any data from salons or clients beyond what is explicitly entered by them. This includes refraining from collecting information about device type, IP address, operating systems and their versions, programs, languages, or any other data or network information.
